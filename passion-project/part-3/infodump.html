                        <figcaption class="width">I just recently moved and put a hummingbird feeder right by my kitchen window and hummingbirds have been coming to visit it every day (usually multiple times). It's really special for me to see them because I didn't get a lot of hummingbirds at my last place (where I was living when I first started birdwatching) so this is really the first time I'm seeing them up close like this.

                        I like to tell people about Mourning Doves because most people are famliar with their call (which I find to be soothing/comforting) but they may not know that it's coming from a Mourning Dove when they hear it. Also, I just learned that apparently some people think they went extinct but that is not true- they are very much still around.</a>
