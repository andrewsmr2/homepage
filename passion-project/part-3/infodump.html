                            <figcaption>I just recently moved and put a hummingbird feeder right by my kitchen window and hummingbirds have been coming to visit it every day (usually multiple times). It's really special for me to see them because I didn't get a lot of hummingbirds at my last place (where I was living when I first started birdwatching) so this is really the first time I'm seeing them up close like this.

                             <figcaption>Buncha sparrows sitting on my fence. I guess they are social because I see them in big groups like this a lot. I think it's cute to see them all hanging out together.</figcaption>

                            <figcaption>One time, I left a bowl of water outside for my dog and forgot about it and when I later went to leave the house, I saw that birds were drinking out of the water bowl and using it as a birdbath. I just stood by the door taking videos of them with my phone until they were done.</figcaption>

                    <p>I like to tell people about Mourning Doves because most people are famliar with their call (which is really soothing, in my opinion) but they may not know that it's coming from a Mourning Dove when they hear it. <br><br>
                    Also, apparently some people think they went extinct but that is not true- they are very much still around.</p>
