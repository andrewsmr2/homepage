        <p>Over the past 2 years or so, I've slowly but surely been getting into birdwatching. It started out with me just trying to notice and identify birds that I saw out and about.  Then I got some birdfeeders and a pair of binoculars and started to learn how to identify the birds that came to my birdfeeders. I'm not as hardcore as some people (for example, some people get up really early to go birdwatching and may even take trips just to go see different types of birds in different locations).  As of this point in my life, I'm still mostly someone who just watches the birds in my backyard at my birdfeeders and tries to notice the birds I see when I'm out and about but I find myself slowly getting more and more into this hobby so maybe I'll eventually become the type of person who takes trips just to go look for birds that I've never seen before. Only time will tell.

       <p> <b><i>Reasons why I like birdwatching: </b></i> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You don't have to spend any money to birdwatch if you don't want to. It does help to have a pair of binoculars and some people go so far as to buy fancy cameras with long lenses but you don't technically need anything to birdwatch except for vision and the ability to hear (and even if you are vision or hearing impaired, as long as you have access to one of those senses, you can still participate in birdwatching).</li>
                <li>I think it's honestly just a lovely hobby that inadvertently forces you to be mindful and present and also to be appreciative of nature and your surroundings. You also don't take anything in the process, you just simply observe and appreciate.</li>
                <li>You can be as casual or as hardcore about it as you want.</li>
                <li>I don't know if anyone played that pokemon game that was really popular a while back but each time you see a new bird or even just a bird you don't see very often, it feels special- like you're catching a new pokemon.</li>
            </ul>

            On this webpage, I am sharing my "life list" with you all. In the context of birdwatching, a "life list" is a list of all the species of birds that a person has seen over their lifetime. For me, my life list consists of all of the birds that I've seen and have been able to identify since I first started birdwatching a few years ago. I keep track of this by using the app <a href="https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/">Merlin Bird ID.</a> This is a free app that helps you identify birds that you see or hear. It also allows you to track which birds you've seen and have been able to identify (hence my life list). <i>Disclaimer:</i> All of these birds were seen in the state of Virginia, mostly around Richmond. 
        </p>
        <p>So, without further ado, here is my life list broken down into several categories:</p>
        <h2>My favorites</h2>

        <p><i><mark>**BEWARE:</mark></i> <small>Hawks will sometimes hunt at birdfeeders. If you ever see a hawk lurking near your birdfeeder (sometimes you won't be able to see them) but if you do see this happening, put your birdfeeders inside for a few days.  Learn from my mistake and save yourself the trauma...</small></p>
