            <h1>Pictures of birds that I took</h1>
            <h3>There are some videos, too </h3>
                <p>I don't have the best camera for taking pictures of birds but here are a few pics/videos I took:</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/rubythroatedhummingbirdbyme.JPG" alt="A ruby-throated hummingbird drinks out of a hummingbird feeder." width="500" height="400">
                            <figcaption>I just recently moved and put a hummingbird feeder right by my kitchen window and hummingbirds have been coming to visit it every day (usually multiple times). It's really special for me to see them because I didn't get a lot of hummingbirds at my last place (where I was living when I first started birdwatching) so this is really the first time I'm seeing them up close like this.

                             <figcaption>Buncha sparrows sitting on my fence. I guess they are social because I see them in big groups like this a lot. I think it's cute to see them all hanging out together.</figcaption>

                        <img src="images/greatblueheronbyme.JPG" alt="A great blue heron perched on a fallen tree that is sticking out of a lake. The scene consists of many bare tree branches overlapping each other." width="500" height="400">

                            <figcaption>Pileated Woodpecker.  They are really pretty striking to see because they are HUGE! They typically range from 16-19 inches long.</figcaption>

                            <figcaption>One time, I left a bowl of water outside for my dog and forgot about it and when I later went to leave the house, I saw that birds were drinking out of the water bowl and using it as a birdbath. I just stood by the door taking videos of them with my phone until they were done.</figcaption>
