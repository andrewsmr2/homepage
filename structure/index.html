                I wanted to die, I'm just being honest<br>
                No longer afraid to say it out loud<br>
                So, I put my hair on your chest 'til I hear the answer<br>
                Love in motion seems to save me now<br><br>

                Love in motion, my heart's open<br>
                Thank you, thank you, I'm okay<br>
                'Cause you care, I made it through today<br><br>

                I once had a dream that shadows took over<br>
                (Tears were fallin' like rain)<br>
                I must've cried out, 'cause you were awake<br>
                (You're the only one who really cares what I say)<br>
                You turned on the light as you put me closer<br>
                (All I know is that no one loves me like you)<br>
                Love in motion seems to save me now<br><br>

                Love in motion, my heart's open<br>
                Thank you, thank you, I'm okay<br>
                'Cause you care, I made it through today<br><br>

                (Like you, like)<br>
                No one loves me like you (Like)<br>
                (Like) No-no-no-no (You)<br>
                No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no<br>
                No-no-no-no, (Like) no-no-no-no (You)<br>
                No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no, no<br><br>

                Love in motion, my heart's open<br>
                Thank you, thank you, I'm okay<br>
                'Cause you care, I made it through today<br><br>

                No-no-no-no<br>
                No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no<br>
                No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no<br>
                No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no<br><br>

                        Opens with soft piano, singer sings in soft soprano voice. Some electronic elements come in at chorus. Singer does interesting things with voice here, jumping form one octave to the next (or maybe it's not a full octave, but if it's not, it's close).<br><br>
                         The tempo picks up during chorus as the song continues then eventually goes back to a more delicate, softer place while the song fades out. Google describes the genre of this album as "art-pop/avant-pop" and it was released in 2022.

                Untie me, I've said no vows<br>
                The train is getting way too loud<br>
                I've gotta leave here, my girl, get on with my lonely life<br>
                Just leave the ring on the rail for the wheels to nullify<br><br>
                Until this turned in my head<br>
                I let you stay and you paid no rent<br>
                I spent 12 long months on the lam<br>
                That's enough sitting on the fence for the fear of breaking dams<br><br>
                I'd find a fatal flaw in the logic of love<br>
                And go out of my head<br>
                You love a sinking stone that'll never elope<br>
                So get used to the lonesome<br>
                Girl, you must atone some<br>
                Don't leave me no phone number there<br><br>
                It took me all of a year to put the poison pill to your ear<br>
                But now I stand on honest ground, on honest ground<br>
                You want to fight for this love, but honey, you cannot wrestle a dove<br>
                So baby, it's clear<br><br>
                You want to jump and dance, but you sat on your hands<br>
                And lost your only chance<br>
                Go back to your hometown, get your feet on the ground<br>
                And stop floating around<br><br>
                I found a fatal flaw in the logic of love<br>
                And went out of my head<br>
                You love a sinking stone that'll never elope<br>
                So get used to the lonesome<br>
                Girl, you must atone some<br>
                Don't leave me no phone number there<br><br>

                        This song opens up with upbeat guitar strumming at a pace that's neither fast nor slow. It's got some country vibes, for sure, although I think this band is from the UK (whoops- just googled it and apparently they're from New Mexico). <br><br>
                        
                        Google describes this song's genre as alternative / indie / folk. The singer's tone is clear and declarative.  Overall, the song has upbeat vibes without being frantic. This song was released in 2003. <br><br>

                        It's possible they used one of these, which is probably why I get the "country vibes": <br><br>

                        Google doesn't list a genre for this one which sucks for me but I'm going to do my best.  This song gives me jazzy, psychedelic vibes- kind of like you'd see it in a spy movie from the 70's. It's an instrumental song with a large band consisting of quite a few different instruments -- including brass instruments, guitar, bass, drums and probably more (for example, there's some plucking of some type of string instrument- I'm just not sure what specifically).

                        This song opens up with soft guitar strumming along with some light guitar picking that comes in on top of that a few seconds later.  Overall, the song is pretty mellow and a bit sad but also bittersweet and reflective. <br><br>
                        
                        Eventually another instrument comes in around the chorus and I couldn't quite figure out what instrument it was at first but it kind of sounds like an old piano in an echoey room. <br><br>
                        
                        The song consists of a singular person singing for the most part, with harmonizing vocals popping in every now and then. The pace is on the slower side, but not too slow (like, it could be slower).

                        This is an instrumental interlude (which is a musical composition inserted between the parts of a longer composition... <small><i> thanks, Merriam-Webster</i></small>) that starts off with dramatic strings that kind of build up like a tornado forming. <br><br>
                        
                        The song has a cinematic feel, in my opinion, like you could find it on the soundtrack of a movie. It's dramatic and theatrical and it's performed by an orchestra consisting of string instruments and some other instruments- I'm honestly not sure if they are woodwind or brass instruments but it's got to be one of the two.

                    And you're the reason I never get to go to the beauty shop<br>

                    Conway, why in the devil don't you go and shave<br>
                    And put on a clean pair of pants?<br><br>

                    And get out of that housecoat before supper<br><br>
                    Ha, well let me tell you something, Conway<br>

                    Besides that, all our kids took after your part of the family, anyway<br><br>

                        I saw it<br>
                        Hit the ground<br>
                        But no one<br>
                        Was around <br><br>
                        
                        Carrying the dummy and always the same as you<br>
                        Same as you<br>
                        Ancient wallpaper, I can walk and talk and sing <br>straight out<br>
                        As you<br>
                        As you <br><br>
                        
                        There were ticking bloody watches in our hands<br>
                        Poured into the soil we written letters<br>
                        Have another heart attack and folding up our chairs<br>
                        Open up your mouth, where you want to go? <br><br>
                        
                        I can hardly recognize the shapes<br>
                        The shapes<br>
                        Wandering through Chinatown, white strands under<br> artificial heat<br>
                        Artificial heat<br>
                        Slip down the middle with some small teeth<br>
                        Alright <br><br>

                    I could never build the ether<br>
                    Or the grass overgrown<br>
                    I could never build the river<br>
                    With a mouthful of foam<br>
                    I could never build the winter<br>
                    With her cold tears of glitter<br>

                    I've been listening to the red oak<br>
                    And the acorn she cries<br>
                    Listening to the white birch<br>
                    And the paper she dries<br>
                    I've been listening to the frog's joke<br>
                    Listening to the firesmoke<br>
                    I can never tell you now<br>
                    What I'd often said before<br>
                    Because promise is a pendulum<br>
                    Just swinging at the door<br>
                    And I'm not saying I'm not jealous<br>
                    Or scared anymore<br>
                    I'm just saying<br>
                    I could never build a rainbow<br>
                    Or any kind of flower<br>
                    I could never make a sparrow<br>
                    Or a meteor shower<br>
                    I could never build an earthworm<br>
                    Could never make the earth turn<br>
                    I've been listening to the laughing<br>
                    Of the fox down the trail<br>
                    I've been clasping to the <br>listening of the moss to the snail
                    The shimmer of the beech leaves<br>
                    As the wind does a big sneeze<br>
                    I could never tell you now<br>
                    What I'd often said before<br>
                    Because promise is a pendulum<br>

                    Or scared anymore<br>
                    I'm just saying<br>
                    I could never build the shadow<br>
                    Between your cheek and your eye<br>
                    I could never make a freckle or the warm breath you sigh<br>
                    In the canopy of lashes<br>
                    With the softness of ashes<br>
                    I've been listening to the memory<br>
                    The way that it was<br>
                    Listening to the echo of whys and because<br>
                    Listening to the echo<br>
                    Telling me to let go<br>
                    I could never tell you now<br>
                    What I'd often said before<br>
                    Because promise is a pendulum<br>
                    Just hanging at the door<br>
                    And I'm not saying I'm not jealous<br>
                    Or scared anymore<br>
                    I'm just saying<br>
                    Saying<br>

                    Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving <br>
                    But how can they know it's time for them to go? <br>
                    Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming <br>
                    I have no thought of time <br>
                    For who knows where the time goes? <br>
                    Who knows where the time goes? <br>
                    Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving <br>
                    Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go <br>
                    But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving <br>
                    I do not count the time <br>
                    For who knows where the time goes? <br>
                    Who knows where the time goes? <br>
                    And I am not alone while my love is near me <br>
                    I know it will be so until it's time to go <br>
                    So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again <br>
                    I have no fear of time <br>
                    For who knows how my love grows? <br>
                    And who knows where the time goes? <br>

                    It's the end, friend of mine<br>
                    It's the end, friend of mine<br>
                    time is over where we could simply say I love you<br>
                    Now you opened the door<br>
                    Leave me crying<br>
                    Trying to embrace you again<br>
                    Trying to face this damn situation man,
                    I can't<br>
                    It's the end, friend of mine<br>
                    It's the end, sweet friend of mine<br>
                    dear friend, I cannot tell the reasons why we started well<br>
                    Good time, give me some wine when you open the door<br>
                    You seem hurt, don't try to speak a word to me<br>
                    What on earth could really go wrong with you and me?<br>
                    Yet its the end, friend of mine<br>
                    It's the end, sweet friend of mine<br>
                    time seems to be over where we could simply say I love you<br>
                    Now you opened the door<br>
                    I feel cold<br>
                    Wakened, I hold you in my arms<br>
                    Told you that life is short but love is old<br>
                    It's the end, friend of mine<br>
                    It's the end, sweet friend<br>
