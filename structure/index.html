                I wanted to die, I'm just being honest<br>
                No longer afraid to say it out loud<br>
                So, I put my ear to your chest 'til I heard the answer<br>
                Love in motion seems to save me now<br><br>

                Love in motion, my heart's open<br>
                Thank you, thank you, I'm okay<br>
                'Cause you care, I made it through today<br><br>

                I once had a dream that shadows took over<br>
                (Tears were fallin' like rain)<br>
                I must've cried out, 'cause you were awake<br>
                (You're the only one who really cares what I say)<br>
                You turned on the light as you pulled me closer<br>
                (All I know is that no one loves me like you)<br>
                Love in motion seems to save me now<br><br>

                Love in motion, my heart's open<br>
                Thank you, thank you, I'm okay<br>
                'Cause you care, I made it through today<br><br>

                (Like you, like)<br>
                No one loves me like you (Like)<br>
                (Like) No-no-no-no (You)<br>
                No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no<br>
                No-no-no-no, (Like) no-no-no-no (You)<br>
                No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no, no<br><br>

                Love in motion, my heart's open<br>
                Thank you, thank you, I'm okay<br>
                'Cause you care, I made it through today<br><br>

                No-no-no-no<br>
                No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no<br>
                No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no<br>

                        Opens with soft piano, singer sings in soft soprano voice. Some electronic elements come in at chorus. Singer does interesting things with voice here, jumping from one octave to the next (or maybe it's not a full octave. But if it's not, it's close).<br><br>

                         The beat picks up during chorus as the song continues then eventually goes back to a softer, more delicate place while the song fades out. Google describes the genre of this album as "art-pop/avant-pop" and it was released in 2022.

                Untie me, I've said no vows<br>
                The train is getting way too loud<br>
                I've gotta leave here, my girl, get on with my lonely life<br>
                Just leave the ring on the rail for the wheels to nullify<br><br>

                Until this turned in my head<br>
                I let you stay and you paid no rent<br>
                I spent 12 long months on the lam<br>
                That's enough sitting on the fence for the fear of breaking dams<br><br>

                I find a fatal flaw in the logic of love<br>
                And go out of my head<br>
                You love a sinking stone that'll never elope<br>
                So get used to the lonesome<br>
                Girl, you must atone some<br>
                Don't leave me no phone number there<br><br>

                It took me all of a year to put the poison pill to your ear<br>
                But now I stand on honest ground, on honest ground<br>
                You want to fight for this love, <br>
                but honey, you cannot wrestle a dove<br>
                So baby, it's clear<br><br>

                You want to jump and dance, but you sat on your hands<br>
                And lost your only chance<br>
                Go back to your hometown, get your feet on the ground<br>
                And stop floating around<br><br>

                I found a fatal flaw in the logic of love<br>
                And went out of my head<br>
                You love a sinking stone that'll never elope<br>
                So get used to the lonesome<br>
                Girl, you must atone some<br>
                Don't leave me no phone number there<br><br>

                        This song opens up with upbeat guitar strumming at a pace that's neither fast nor slow. To me, the song has some slight country vibes. It's possible they used one of these, which is probably why I get those vibes: <br><br>

                        Google describes this song's genre as alternative / indie / folk. The singer's tone is clear and declarative.  Overall, the song has pleasant, upbeat vibes without being frantic. This song was released in 2003. <br><br>

                        Google doesn't list a genre for this one which sucks for me but I'm going to do my best.  The best way that I can figure out how to describe this song is that it kind of sounds like you might hear it in a spy movie from the 70's (even though it was actually released in 2008). <br><br>
                        
                       I honestly don't quite know how to describe this song genre-wise but it's kind of slinky and funky.<br><br>
                        
                        It's an instrumental song consisting of brass instruments but other instruments, as well- including  guitar, bass, drums and more (for example, there's some plucking of some type of string instrument- I'm just not sure what instrument it is specifically, though).

                        This song opens up with soft guitar strumming along with some light guitar picking that comes in on top of that a few seconds later.  Overall, the song is mellow and a bit sad but also bittersweet and reflective. <br><br>
                        
                        Eventually another instrument comes in and I couldn't quite figure out what instrument it was at first but it kind of sounds like an old piano in an echoey room. <br><br>
                        
                        Throughout the song, there is a singular person singing, for the most part, with harmonizing vocals popping in every now and then. This song was released in 1975 and in terms of genre- I'd say it's kind of folky.

                        This is an instrumental interlude (which is a musical composition inserted between the parts of a longer composition... <small><i> thanks, Merriam-Webster</i></small>) that starts off with dramatic strings that kind of whir up like a tornado forming. <br><br>
                        
                        The song has a cinematic feel, in my opinion- like you could find it on the soundtrack of a movie. It's dramatic and theatrical and it's performed by an orchestra consisting of string instruments and some other instruments- I'm honestly not sure if they are woodwind or brass instruments but it's got to be one of the two.

                        This is a country duet that was released in 1978. Honestly, the word that comes to mind when I hear this song is "sassy". It's got a sassy guitar intro, then some sassy keys come in.  I feel like the instrumentals tie in well with the overall theme of the lyrics. The pace is neither fast nor slow. Eventually, a violin and harmonica pop in for brief moments. <br><br>
                        
                        At the end of the song, the singers stop singing and they start a dialogue where they are talking to one another, fussing at each other in sassy tones but they end up laughing with one another before the song fades out.

                        I saw it<br>
                        Hit the ground<br>
                        But no one<br>
                        Was around <br><br>
                        
                        Carrying the dummy and always the same as you<br>
                        Same as you<br>
                        Ancient wallpaper, I can walk and talk and sing <br>straight out<br>

                        Have another heart attack and folding up our chairs<br>

                        Artificial heat<br>
                        Slip down the middle with some small teeth<br>

                        Fast-paced. Jumpy, almost. 2 guitars are just pluckin' away for most of the song. There is also a bass and drums.<br><br>
                        
                        It's honestly kind of hard to decipher the lyrics just by listening (at least for me it is). I've liked this song for over a decade and I'm just now learning what the lyrics are, as a result of looking them up for this website lol. I guess the singers could work on annunication. <br><br>

                    I could never build the ether<br>
                    Or the grass overgrown<br>
                    I could never build the river<br>
                    With a mouthful of foam<br>
                    I could never build the winter<br>
                    With her cold tears of glitter<br><br>

                    I've been listening to the red oak<br>
                    And the acorn she cries<br>
                    Listening to the white birch<br>
                    And the paper she dries<br>
                    I've been listening to the frog's joke<br>
                    Listening to the firesmoke<br><br>

                    I can never tell you now<br>
                    What I'd often said before<br>
                    Because promise is a pendulum<br>
                    Just swinging at the door<br>
                    And I'm not saying I'm not jealous<br>
                    Or scared anymore<br>
                    I'm just saying<br><br>

                    I could never build a rainbow<br>
                    Or any kind of flower<br>
                    I could never make a sparrow<br>
                    Or a meteor shower<br>
                    I could never build an earthworm<br>
                    Could never make the earth turn<br><br>

                    I've been listening to the laughing<br>
                    Of the fox down the trail<br>
                    I've been clasping to the listening of the moss to the snail <br>
                    The shimmer of the beech leaves<br>
                    As the wind does a big sneeze<br><br>

                    I could never tell you now<br>
                    What I'd often said before<br>
                    Because promise is a pendulum<br>

                    And I'm not saying I'm not jealous<br>
                    Or scared anymore<br>
                    I'm just saying<br><br>

                    I could never build the shadow<br>
                    Between your cheek and your eye<br>
                    I could never make a freckle or the warm breath you sigh<br>
                    In the canopy of lashes<br>
                    With the softness of ashes<br><br>

                    I've been listening to the memory<br>
                    The way that it was<br>
                    Listening to the echo of whys and because<br>
                    Listening to the echo<br>
                    Telling me to let go<br><br>

                    I could never tell you now<br>
                    What I'd often said before<br>
                    Because promise is a pendulum<br>
                    Just hanging at the door<br>
                    And I'm not saying I'm not jealous<br>

                    I'm just saying<br>

                        Really simple and soft. Slow paced, soft guitar picking. The simplicity of the sound leaves plenty of room for the lyrics to breathe.  "Gentle" is a word that comes to mind.<br><br>

                        Organs kick in at the beginning of the song and you can already tell it's a dancey vibe.  Multiple high pitched vocals pop in after some guitar and drums start playing and the vibe get's pretty 80s synth-pop and honestly, it's a fun time.  This song came out in 1978. <br><br>

                        Upbeat, faster-paced. The singer sings in an animated manner- it's almost a mixture of singing and talking. There are some trumpets here and there. Also little high-pitched synthy sounds that could be described like little butterflies scratching a specific part of your brain. <br><br>

                        At the end of the song, they make it sound like the singer and instruments are robots that are having a malfunction (or a record skipping- whichever metaphor you like better).<br>

                        Another soft, slow-paced, dreamy song.  The song starts with a guitar strumming quietly at an even pace and this persists throughout the entire song, with some picking here and there. Some light and fluttery piano shows up about halfway through the song (along with what might be an organ? Or maybe a keyboard with an organ setting- that's probably more likely). There are also bells in this song. <br><br>

                        The singer changes her tone at times, making her words sharper and quicker - like they're meant to cut. <br><br>

                        This song was a live performance and ends with the sound of a crowd clapping.

                        Google describes this song as pop, but I would be inclined to call it a disco song, as well (although maybe I just automatically associate Donna Summer with disco). This song came out in 1978.<br><br>

                        Song starts off dreamy and romantic, with strings and flutes/other woodwind instruments, possibly. There are also some keys and those types of bells  that you hold and drag a stick along. <br><br>

                        After a while, the tempo/beat kick up all of a sudden and the song's tone changes from soft and dreamy to upbeat and celebratory. <br><br>

                        At this point, the song sounds like a fun disco song (to me, at least). The song ends quickly and triumphantly after a few quick, sharp notes from the instruments.

                        Solemn and sad. There's almost an ache in the singer's voice. The song consists of soft, slow guitar picking at an even pace with one person singing.<br><br>

                        Google describes this song as: alternative / indie and folk. It was released in 2006 but was recorded decades earlier (Google says that it was recorded between 1970 and 1973).
