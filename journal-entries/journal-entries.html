            <summary><i><b>My Website is a Shifting House...</i></b>by Laurel Schwulst</summary>
            <p>
                This is not the first time that I have been assigned this reading, but to be totally honest- I struggled a bit with this reading both times it was assigned to me. My brain is extremely literal and can have a tough time with abstract metaphors. 
            <br><br>
                Laurel mentioned that her students asked her how to “actually make a website” at the end of her class that she teaches. To be honest, I can understand where her students were coming from. As students, we want to feel prepared for the expectations that will likely be thrown our way when we apply for jobs/try to find work. And I think being familiar with/knowing how to emulate current trends is a pretty common expectation. I appreciate Laurel taking a step back to really analyze this question instead of being dismissive to a question that, clearly,  many people have.  
            <br><br>
                And I do understand where she’s coming from when she mentions that when we think of a website, many of us tend to think of what websites look like at this very moment in time, and that this could be considered somewhat of a narrow-minded approach.  I do think that, as designers, our work will certainly be more interesting and powerful if we can remain open-minded and commit to broadening our thinking patterns and approaches. And I think Laurel is trying to facilitate this in this essay. 
            <br><br>
                While I had trouble wrapping my brain around everything that Laurel said in this essay, I think I get the general gist of what she’s saying. I can also appreciate the fact that Laurel is encouraging individuals to take up space on the web as an act of rebellion against the mass commercialization of the internet. She's right in that there are a lot of forces in play that don't prioritize or even care about their users' best interests/needs and I appreciate her call to action for individuals and artists to put forth an effort to guide the web in a healthier direction.

            <summary><i><b>A Rant About "Technology"</i></b> by Ursula K. Le Guin</summary>
            <p>
                I was assigned this reading in another class and I remember that, back then, it did challenge my perspective on the idea of what technology is, something I hadn’t thought too much about before. After reading it then, I came to the conclusion that technology is really any man-made tool that we use to make life easier in some way, shape, or form. 
            <br><br>
                After reading this a second time, I found myself thinking about the knee-jerk associations we have with words. Ursula talks about the associations we have when it comes to the terms “high-tech” vs. “low-tech”, and how we can often think of low-tech items as less impressive than high-tech items, such as a computer. But I agree with her in that low-tech items are not necessarily “simple”, even if they appear to be. 
            <br><br>
                I am particularly interested in accessibility (both in a digital context as well as in "real-life"/in-person scenarios) and one thing that I've been learning about lately is assistive technology.  If you look into different examples of assistive technology, you see all sorts of different devices- both "high-tech" and "low-tech". 
            <br><br>
                A screen reader or a speech-generating device are examples of assistive technology, but you could also consider noise-reducing/noise-canceling earplugs to be assistive technology. I use those myself, actually, and they are just little objects made of either plastic or silicone, etc. and all I have to do is put them in my ears. No buttons or wires or electricity, just a little plastic/silicone object that I put in my ear.  But they are considered forms of assistive technology, and I think this is not irrelevant when it comes to the theme of this essay. 
            <br><br>
                One line that stood out to me was “As if linen were the same thing as flax”. This made me think about the process of the development of technology and the human’s role within that. 
                In that paragraph, she talks about tools such as paper or wheels, which have been around for a very long time but even when you think about modern-day technology, humans are still pretty necessary parts of the development of technology (I don’t know how AI will evolve in the future and if, at any point, this will not always be true but that’s a can of worms that I’m not going to open right now).  
            <br><br>   
                I will say (even though I just said I wasn’t going to talk about AI), I recently watched a video where someone was talking about AI in the context of how it can help disabled folks and she kept talking about  the fact that humans are tool-using creatures. Ultimately, technology is a tool and since humans have the ability to think critically, we can and should think about the tools we use (especially when it comes to new forms of technology) and the cultural/societal impact those tools may have.
            <br><br>
                I preferred this reading over the essay by Laurel Schwulst. It was easier for my brain to understandand and I like how the author's tone is poetic, at times, but still straight-forward. I just generally have a preference for plain language.
